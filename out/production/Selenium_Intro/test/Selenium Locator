There are mainly 2 methods helps us to findElements:
findElement() method returns a single web element and it can be stored in a WebElement variable
findElements() method returns a list of web elements and they can be stored in an ArrayList<WebElement>

All these methods are used with web elements and return true or false:
isDisplayed() method is used to verify the presence of a particular web element and it will return true if element is found, and false otherwise
isEnabled() is mostly used with buttons and it verifies if the web element is enabled or disabled
isSelected() is mostly used with radio buttons, dropdowns and checkboxes and it verifies if the web element is selected or not

SELENIUM LOCATORS (8):
1. className = to find web elements based on the unique class attribute values of the DOM.
2. id = most common ways of identifying elements on a web page. id for a web element always needs to be unique (1 of 1).
It is the fastest way of locating web elements and is most reliable(stable) methods for determining an element.
3. name = a web page can have multiple elements with the same name attribute. If locating by name, always make sure that the name attribute is unique in the DOM.
4. tagName = the tag name is the HTML tag, such as input, div, anchor tag, button, etc. The tagName locator returns all the elements from the page that has the specified tag.
5. linkText and 6. partialLinkText = used to locate web elements by using the hyperlink texts. Therefore web element must contain anchor (<a></a>) tags.
7. CSS Selector (2nd fastest). Syntax ---> CSS Selector: tagName[attribute='value']
8. XPath (most flexible). Syntax ---> Absolute XPath: /html/body/form/div/span/span
                                      Relative XPath: //tagName[@attributeName=’value’]
NOTE: Like the other locator strategies, if multiple hyperlinks with the same texts are present on the page, then Selenium will always choose the FIRST one.
NOTE: name, link text, className, id, partial link text, tag name locators are looking for the given attribute name, and, finding the matching attribute value.
